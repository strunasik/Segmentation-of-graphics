# Segmentation-of-graphics
This application implements k-nearest neighbors algorithm on graphics. As a input data it takes each pixel and makes algorithm computations on RGB vector. The result is segmentation of graphics. The program works both in Iterative and Asynchronous modes. Also you are able to set a number of centroids which defines a number of colors on your output picture.

##### Here how it looks:

###### As this is a desktop application there is simple interface that allows you to choose file and than save it ;)
